# Brand Voice Service Testing Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the testing strategy for the Brand Voice Service, with particular focus on the `updateBrandVoice` method that has been enhanced with retry logic and exponential backoff.

## Testing Approach

We will use a multi-layered testing approach to ensure the Brand Voice Service is functioning correctly:

1. **Unit Tests**: Verify individual methods with mocked dependencies
2. **Integration Tests**: Test interaction with the backend API
3. **Manual Testing**: Perform real-world scenarios to validate functionality

## Test Environments

- **Local Development**: Run against local backend (http://localhost:8000)
- **Staging**: Test against staging environment before deployment
- **Production**: Verify functionality after deployment

## Test Cases

### 1. Unit Tests

Located at: `/frontend/tests/brand-voice-service.test.ts`

These tests focus on the behavior of the service methods with mocked dependencies:

- Verify successful brand voice updates
- Test retry logic with simulated network failures
- Validate fallback to XMLHttpRequest when primary request fails
- Confirm proper error handling after max retries
- Test exponential backoff timing

### 2. Integration Tests

The manual test script at `/frontend/src/scripts/test-brand-voice.ts` provides integration testing:

- Create a new brand voice
- Retrieve a brand voice by ID
- Update a brand voice (testing retry logic)
- Get version history
- Publish a brand voice
- Analyze content with brand voice
- Delete a brand voice

### 3. Manual Testing Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Normal Operation
1. Create a brand voice with valid data
2. Update the brand voice with new information
3. Verify changes are saved correctly

#### Scenario 2: Network Resilience
1. Create a brand voice
2. Simulate network instability (e.g., throttle connection)
3. Update the brand voice
4. Verify the update succeeds despite network issues

#### Scenario 3: Error Handling
1. Attempt to update a non-existent brand voice
2. Verify appropriate error message is displayed
3. Confirm application remains stable

## Running the Tests

### Unit Tests
```bash
cd frontend
npm test -- -t "Brand Voice Service"
```

### Integration Tests
```bash
cd frontend
npx ts-node src/scripts/test-brand-voice.ts
```

### Manual Testing
1. Start the backend server:
```bash
cd backend
python -m uvicorn main:app --reload
```

2. Start the frontend development server:
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

3. Navigate to the Brand Voice section in the application
4. Perform the test scenarios described above

## Validation Criteria

The implementation is considered successful if:

1. All unit tests pass
2. Integration tests complete without errors
3. Manual testing scenarios can be performed without issues
4. The `updateBrandVoice` method successfully retries on network failures
5. Appropriate error messages are displayed when operations fail
6. No regression in existing functionality

## Monitoring

After deployment, monitor the following:

1. Error rates in brand voice operations
2. Success rate of brand voice updates
3. Average response time for brand voice operations
4. Number of retry attempts needed for successful operations

## Rollback Plan

If issues are detected:

1. Revert to the previous stable version of the brand-voice-service.ts file
2. Deploy the rollback
3. Verify functionality returns to previous state
4. Investigate and fix issues in a development environment
