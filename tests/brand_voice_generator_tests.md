# Brand Voice Generator Tests

This document provides instructions for running the test scripts for the Brand Voice Generator feature.

## Test Structure

The tests are organized in three layers:

1. **Backend Tests**: Test the LangGraph agent and API endpoints
2. **Frontend Tests**: Test the frontend service and UI components
3. **End-to-End Tests**: Test the entire application workflow

## Prerequisites

- Backend server running on port 8001
- Frontend development server running on port 3000
- Python 3.8+ for backend tests
- Node.js 14+ for frontend tests
- Playwright installed for E2E tests (`npm install -D playwright`)

## Running Backend Tests

### 1. Test the Brand Voice Generator Agent

This test validates that the LangGraph agent correctly generates brand voice components.

```bash
cd /Users/nitinsareen/Documents/GitHub/nitin-sareen/ContentPlatform/backend
python -m tests.brand_voice_generator.test_generator_agent
```

### 2. Test the API Endpoints

This test validates that the FastAPI endpoints for the brand voice generator work correctly.

```bash
cd /Users/nitinsareen/Documents/GitHub/nitin-sareen/ContentPlatform/backend
python -m tests.brand_voice_generator.test_api_endpoints
```

## Running Frontend Tests

### 1. Test the Brand Voice Service

This test validates that the frontend service correctly communicates with the backend API.

```bash
cd /Users/nitinsareen/Documents/GitHub/nitin-sareen/ContentPlatform/frontend
npx jest tests/brand-voice-generator/test-brand-voice-service.js
```

### 2. Test the UI Components

This test validates that the React components for the brand voice generator work correctly.

```bash
cd /Users/nitinsareen/Documents/GitHub/nitin-sareen/ContentPlatform/frontend
npx jest tests/brand-voice-generator/test-generator-components.js
```

## Running End-to-End Tests

This test validates the entire brand voice generator workflow from the main application.

```bash
cd /Users/nitinsareen/Documents/GitHub/nitin-sareen/ContentPlatform
npx playwright test tests/e2e/brand_voice_generator_e2e.js
```

## Test Data

All tests use the same sample content for consistency:

recyclable materials and ethical manufacturing processes.

```

## Troubleshooting

### Backend Tests

- Make sure the backend server is running on port 8001
- Check that the LangGraph dependencies are installed
- Verify that the database migrations have been applied

### Frontend Tests

- Make sure the frontend development server is running
- Check that the API URL in the tests matches your backend server
- Verify that all UI components are correctly imported

### End-to-End Tests

- Make sure both backend and frontend servers are running
- Check that the APP_URL in the test matches your frontend server
- Increase the timeout values if tests fail due to slow responses

## Expected Results

All tests should pass with output similar to:

```
âœ… All tests passed!
```

If a test fails, it will provide detailed error information to help diagnose the issue.
