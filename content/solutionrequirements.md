1.2 Scope
The platform will enable business users to:

Onboard brands as tenants

Define and manage Brand Voices via GenAI

Configure and execute content-generation/localization workflows

Expose APIs for batch and real-time integrations

Monitor, explain and iterate on AI outcomes via feedback loops

It targets content-centric enterprises (e.g., retail, CPG, beauty tech) requiring scalable, self-service localization and creative content pipelines.

1.3 Definitions & Acronyms

Tenant: A distinct brand/organization within the platform.

Agentic AI: Multi-agent orchestration leveraging LLMs to decide workflows.

Brand Voice: A persistent GenAI-derived persona (tone, vocabulary, guidelines).

Workflow Task: A unit of content activity (e.g., translate product descriptions).

Design System: Theming assets (fonts, colors, layouts) configurable per tenant.

2. Overall Description

2.1 Product Perspective
Modular microservices on GCP/Azure; frontend SPA (React/Vite/TS/Tailwind); backend APIs (Python/FastAPI); LLM orchestration (LangChain, Langraph, OpenAI, Anthropic).

2.2 User Classes

Business User: Defines Brand Voices, workflows, themes; reviews AI outputs.

Content Specialist: Creates and assigns tasks; approves/generated content.

API Consumer: External CMS or PIM systems integrating via REST/OpenAPI.

Admin: Manages tenant provisioning, user roles, global configuration.

2.3 Operating Environment

Cloud: GCP (Cloud Run, GKE, Pub/Sub, Firestore), optional Azure CosmosDB

Frontend: Modern browsers (Chrome, Edge, Safari)

Backend: Python 3.9+, FastAPI, Redis caching, PostgreSQL for metadata

LLM: Hosted OpenAI/Anthropic or private models via LangChain runners

2.4 Design & Implementation Constraints

API-first, agentic-AI architecture

Self-service for non-technical users

Audit-ready for each AI action

GDPR & CCPA compliance for data processing
